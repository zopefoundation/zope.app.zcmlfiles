Change History
==============

3.5.2 (unreleased)
------------------

- We depended on zope.formlib but didn't include its configuration. Now
  it's included in configure.zcml.

3.5.1 (2008-12-28)
------------------

- Add include of zope.app.schema's configure.zcml. Because component-based
  vocabularies are used everywhere and we need to import zope.app.schema
  somehow to make it work. This is needed because of removal of the include
  of zope.app.schema's meta.zcml in the previous release.

3.5.0 (2008-12-16)
------------------

- Remove deprecated include of zope.app.component.browser meta.zcml.
- Remove deprecated include of zope.app.schema meta.zcml.
- Remove use of zope.modulealias.

3.4.3 (2007-11-01)
------------------

- Fix test failure due to missing ``zope.app.container.browser.ftests``
   directory.  Now it is moved to ``zope.app.container.browser.tests``.

3.4.2 (2007-10-30)
------------------

- Fix test failure due to missing ``zope.app.form.browser.ftests`` directory.
  Now it is moved to ``zope.app.form.browser.tests``.

3.4.1 (2007-10-23)
------------------
